		<Name>Chief-of-Staff</Name>
		<Description>You have no need to speak softly, because you have the biggest stick around. Militarily minded and calculatingly cold, you, and you alone, have the strength to do what needs to be done. Shout at your enemies until they fall into a daze, guard yourself with an army of aides, and show that diplomacy really just means 'force'.</Description>
